## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life! yayy 

```{r, include=FALSE}

load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(tidyverse)
```


put tables in a useable format
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}

#filtered house_elections
house_filtered <- house_elections %>%
  select(fec_id, general_votes, ge_winner)
house_filtered

#filtered candidates
candidates_filtered <- candidates %>% 
   select(-c(cand_st1, cand_st2, cand_city, cand_state,cand_zip))
candidates_filtered

#filtered contributions
contributions_filtered <- contributions %>% 
  select(cmte_id, name, city, state, zip_code, transaction_dt, transaction_amt, cand_id, other_id)
contributions_filtered

 #filter committees 
committees_filtered <- committees %>% 
  select(cmte_id, cmte_name, cmte_city, cmte_state, cmte_zip, cmte_party_affiliation, cand_id)
committees_filtered
```

merge the nice tables
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
house_filtered2 <- house_filtered %>%
  rename(cand_id = fec_id)
house_filtered2
joined_table <- 
  left_join(candidates_filtered, house_filtered2, by = "cand_id")
complete_table <- left_join(joined_table, contributions_filtered, by = "cand_id")
complete_table


```


view the new table
```{r}
# sorting the complete table

specific_races <- complete_table %>%
  filter(cand_election_yr == "2012", cand_office == "S")
specific_races
```
