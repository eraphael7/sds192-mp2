## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life! yayy 

```{r, include=FALSE}

load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(committees)
```

```{r}
glimpse(house_elections)
glimpse(candidates)
```


put tables in a useable format
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}

#filtered house_elections
house_filtered <- house_elections %>%
  select(fec_id, general_votes, ge_winner)
house_filtered

#filtered candidates
candidates_filtered <- candidates %>% 
   select(-c(cand_st1, cand_st2, cand_city, cand_state,cand_zip))
candidates_filtered

#filtered contributions
contributions_filtered <- contributions %>% 
  select(cmte_id, name, city, state, zip_code, transaction_dt, transaction_amt, cand_id, other_id)
contributions_filtered

#filter committees 
committees_filtered <- committees %>% 
  select(cmte_id, cmte_name, cmte_city, cmte_state, cmte_zip, cmte_party_affiliation, cand_id)
committees_filtered
```

merge the nice tables
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
house_elections %>%
  rename(cand_id = fec_id)

joined_table <- merge(candidates_filtered, house_filtered, all = TRUE)
```

view the new table
```{r}
glimpse(joined_table)
```
