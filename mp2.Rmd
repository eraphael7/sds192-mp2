## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life! yayy 

```{r, include=FALSE}

load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(tidyverse)

```


put tables in a useable format
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}

#filtered house_elections
house_filtered <- house_elections %>%
  select(fec_id, general_votes, ge_winner)
house_filtered

#filtered candidates
candidates_filtered <- candidates %>% 
   select(-c(cand_st1, cand_st2, cand_city, cand_state,cand_zip))
candidates_filtered

#filtered contributions
contributions_filtered <- contributions %>% 
  select(cmte_id, name, city, state, zip_code, transaction_dt, transaction_amt, cand_id, other_id)
contributions_filtered

 #filter committees 
committees_filtered <- committees %>% 
  select(cmte_id, cmte_name, cmte_city, cmte_state, cmte_zip, cmte_party_affiliation, cand_id)
committees_filtered
```

merge the nice tables
```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}

house_filtered2 <- house_filtered %>%
  rename(cand_id = fec_id)

house_filtered2

joined_table <- 
  left_join(candidates_filtered, house_filtered2, by = "cand_id")
complete_table <- left_join(joined_table, contributions_filtered, by = "cand_id")

complete_table
```

```{r}
candidatenames <- 
  completedtable %>%
  select(cand_office_state)

kim <- list(candidatenames)
  
```


view the new table
```{r}
# sorting the complete table

presum_races <- complete_table %>%
  filter(cand_election_yr == "2012", cand_office == "S")%>%  
  group_by(cand_name, transaction_dt) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(transaction_amt))
presum_races 
  
```
```{r}


#in class portion
plot <- function (x) {
  presum_races <- presum_races %>%
    filter(cand_office_state == x) 
  
   find_total <- presum_races %>% 
      group_by(cand_id)%>%
      summarise(totalz = sum(abs(transaction_amt)))%>%
      arrange(desc(totalz)) %>%
      mutate( id = row_number())%>% 
      filter(id <= 3)
top3table <- left_join(presum_races, find_total, by = "cand_id")
  
candidate1 <- top3table %>% 
  filter(id == 1) 
candidate2 <- top3table %>%
  filter(id == 2)
candidate3 <- top3table %>% 
  filter(id == 3)
candidate1

plotz <- ggplot(top3table, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = total)) +  
  geom_point(data = candidate1, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = total), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_point(data = candidate2, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = total, color = id), inherit.aes = FALSE) + 
  geom_point()
plotz   
}

plot("CA")
  
  
```
